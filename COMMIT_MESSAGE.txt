feat: Add wallet balance check before course enrollment

## Summary
Implemented wallet balance verification before allowing course enrollment.
The system now checks if user has sufficient balance via HTTP call to account-service.

## Changes

### Learning Service
- Added WalletResponse DTO for receiving wallet information
- Created AppException class for business logic errors
- Added INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE error code (402)
- Updated GlobalExceptionHandler to handle AppException
- Added getWalletByUserId() method to IdentityClient
- Modified EnrollmentService.enroll() to check wallet balance before enrollment
- Fixed MapStruct compilation issues in pom.xml

### Identity Service
- Added GET /api/wallet/user/{userId} endpoint in WalletController
- Endpoint allows internal service-to-service communication

## API Changes

### New Endpoint
- GET /api/wallet/user/{userId} - Get wallet information by user ID

### Modified Behavior
- POST /api/enrollments/{courseId} - Now checks wallet balance before enrollment
  - Returns 402 if insufficient balance
  - Returns 200 if enrollment successful

## Error Response
```json
{
  "code": 402,
  "message": "Insufficient balance in wallet",
  "result": null
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ All services compile without errors
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ No breaking changes

## Deployment Notes
- Deploy identity-service BEFORE learning-service
- No database migration required
- All Dockerfiles already use JDK 17
